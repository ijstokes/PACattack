<p>The IPython notebook is an interactive environment where the user can write Python code within their browser, without needed Python installed in their computer. For this project we created a turtle module to be used in the IPython Notebook. This module that we created was meant to mimic the turtle module used in Python.</p>

<p>The Turtle module is a module used for drawing. The user controls the turtle with simple commands. The commands can manipulate the turtle so it moves, rotates, and while it's moving it can draw (or not draw, depending on whether the user has specified if the "pen" is up or down). If the pen is down and the turtle is moving, it will draw a line under it's path. </p>

<a name="uses-for-the-turtle-module" class="anchor" href="#uses-for-the-turtle-module"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Uses for the Turtle Module</h3>

<p>Using the turtle is simple, and the results of coding actions are immediately visible. This makes it a great way to introduce programming to both children and adults. The visual feedback of the drawing turtle makes programming less abstract for someone who is new to programming. Because of the quick visual feedback of the user's commands, and the IPython Notebook's cell format (allowing the user to see the code directly above their turtle), programming becomes a easier, not only to learn, but also to teach. A teacher can easily teach this to the entire class, and have their students work on it individually because the IPython Notebook is browser based. Users can draw a variety of things using the turtle module.</p>

<a name="using-the-turtle-module" class="anchor" href="#using-the-turtle-module"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Using the Turtle Module</h3>

<p>By importing the module the user can use code to create and manipulate the turtle. An example of commands you can use to draw with the turtle are:</p>

<pre><code>import pacturtle 
T = pacturtle.pacturtle() 
T.speed(7) 
T.right(33) 
T.pensize(4) 
T.forward(70) 
T.left(55) 
T.pencolor("blue") 
T.backward(100) 
</code></pre>

<h3>
<a name="installation-instructions" class="anchor" href="#installation-instructions"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installation Instructions</h3>

<p><strong><em>For Mac:</em></strong></p>

<p>Step 1: Open the terminal. This can be done by clicking the magnifying glass in the top right corner of your screen and typing 'terminal'. You can also find the terminal application in Applications.</p>

<p>Step 2: You will need to go to the directory where you want the IPython Notebook stored. (Hint: You can create a directory by typing <em>mkdir nameofdirectory</em> and then to move into that directory within the terminal type <em>cd nameofdirectory</em>).</p>

<p>Step 3: Type <em>git clone <a href="https://github.com/macewanCMPT395/PACattack.git">https://github.com/macewanCMPT395/PACattack.git</a></em> into the terminal.
This will copy the github repository with the developmental IPython Notebook with the turtle module into your directory.</p>

<p>Step 4: In the terminal type <em>cd pacturtle</em>, this is the directory you will be running the notebook from.</p>

<p>Step 5: To run our developmental IPython application type <em>python -m IPython</em>
in the terminal. This will open the IPython Notebook application in your default browser.</p>

<p>Step 6: Click the "new notebook" button in the top right corner. This will create  new notebook where you can add and run python code.</p>

<p>Step 7: Run some turtle commands (an example can be found if you click the button with "i" at the top of your newly created notebook, or refer to Figure 1) and enjoy making fun pictures!</p>

<p><strong><em>For Windows:</em></strong></p>

<p>Step 1: Open the MS-Dos console, or OS console command prompt.</p>

<p>Step 2: You will need to go to the directory where you want this notebook stored. Change into that directory.</p>

<p>Step 3: Type <em>git clone <a href="https://github.com/macewanCMPT395/PACattack.git">https://github.com/macewanCMPT395/PACattack.git</a></em>
This will copy the github repository with the developmental IPython Notebook with the turtle module into your directory.</p>

<p>Step 4: In the console type <em>cd pacturtle</em>, this is the directory you will be running the notebook from.</p>

<p>Step 5: To run our developmental IPython application type <em>python.exe -m IPython notebook</em>.</p>

<p>If python is not a recognized alias you can also type <em>c:\python27\python.exe -m IPython notebook</em> in the console. Change the directory accordingly to where you installed python.</p>

<p>This will open a IPython Notebook in your default browser.</p>

<p>Step 6: Click the "new notebook" button in the top right corner. This will create  new notebook where you can add and run python code.</p>

<p>Step 7: Run some turtle commands (an example can be found if you click "i" or refer to Figure 1) and enjoy making fun pictures!</p>
